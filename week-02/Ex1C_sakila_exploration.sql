/*
a) Answer to first question as a full sentence. The actor table within columns includes actor_id, first_name, last_name and last_update.
b) Answer to second question as another full sentence. The film table within columns includes film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, original_language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, special_features and last_update.
c) Answer to third question as another full sentence. The table that contains both actor_id and film_id is the film_actor table. 
d) Answer to fourth question as a full sentence. The rental table includes information about each transaction such as rental_id, rental_date, inventory_id, customer_id, return_date, staff_id and last_update. I think is hard to read because it uses IDs instead of names, so you need other tables to understand.
e) Answer to fifth questions as a full sentence. The inventory table includes inventory_id, film_id, store_id and last_update.
f) Answer to sixth questions as another full sentence. To understand the names of all films rented on a specific date, we need to use the rental, inventory and film tables. The rental table tells us when a rental happened and includes inventory_id. The inventory table contacts inventory_id to film_id. The film table contains the film tables. These tables are related through inventory_id and film_id. */
